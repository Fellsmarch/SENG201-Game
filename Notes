We need to know:
- What recovery rate is
- Can you write 'home' instead of a direction to go back home
- Do we have to conform to what they said about GameEnvironment being a simple loop that displays options, can we have our input in different classes/methods like we're trying to do


Powerup/healing items:
    We should change the consumables to objects so that we can store their:
        Price
        Name
        Description
        Effect(?)
    otherwise, we will have to hardcode these in 3-4 times (shop menu, inventory in base & hospital/powerup den)

Hero:
    Could call defense mod armour
    Could call shopPrice mod barter

GameEnvironment:
    Should we have a startGame() method which is called in the main and possibly also a choose direction method?
        However both of these would have similar input code
    Should move the input checkers and text related methods to their own class so we can call from any class

Villain:
    I added an ArrayList of Game to Villain variables and constructor so that when we choose a game we don't have to give a list of games to choose from everytime, the games will always be the same.



Checking input:
Could make this a public method in game_environment and call it with the accepted input range, (printing the text before calling checkInput)
try: 
    userInput = scanner.nextInt(); // checks if input is an int
    if (userInput == 1):
        doThing
    elseif (userInput == 2):
        doThing
    else:
        Sysout("Input was out of range, please try again")
catch exception:
    Sysout("input was not an int")
