We need to know:
- What recovery rate is
- Can you write 'home' instead of a direction to go back home
- Do we have to conform to what they said about GameEnvironment being a simple loop that displays options, can we have our input in different classes/methods like we're trying to do


Hero:
    Could call defense mod armour
    Could call shopPrice mod barter

GameEnvironment:
    Should we have a startGame() method which is called in the main and possibly also a choose direction method?
        However both of these would have similar input code

Villain:
    I added an ArrayList of Game to Villain variables and constructor so that when we choose a game we don't have to give a list of games to choose from everytime, the games will always be the same.



Checking input:
try: 
    userInput = scanner.nextInt(); // checks if input is an int
    if (userInput == 1):
        doThing
    elseif (userInput == 2):
        doThing
    else:
        Sysout("Input was out of range, please try again")
catch exception:
    Sysout("input was not an int")
