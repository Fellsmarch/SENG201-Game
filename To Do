Need to change the three building classes updates to one method that triggers them all. Need to trigger them whenever they enter the shop since teams can update
Need to implement properly Team inventory, hero stats and map use on base (also need to trigger updates on reentry)
Need to change team so that it holds variables like shopPrice and handles death
Need to finish implementing villainsLairPanel -> implement damage to hero/villains, death to hero/villains/team, rewards and continuing to next city
Need to add winning the game

Need to make it look not trash
