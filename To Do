//Need to change the three building classes updates to one method that triggers them all. Need to trigger them whenever they enter the shop since teams can update
//Need to implement properly Team inventory, hero stats and map use on base (also need to trigger updates on reentry)
//Need to change team so that it holds variables like shopPrice and handles death
//Need to finish implementing villainsLairPanel -> implement damage to hero/villains, death to hero/villains/team, rewards and continuing to next city
//Need to add winning the game

Make it so the inventory is sorted (treeMap)

Need to make it look not trash

Known bugs:
Ninja tabi is listed twice in inventory --> probably due to me manually adding it
On new city team powerupHero will trigger warning popup even if powerup is no longer active --> havent removed powerups from team when going to new city
