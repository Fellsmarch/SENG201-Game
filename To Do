//Need to change the three building classes updates to one method that triggers them all. Need to trigger them whenever they enter the shop since teams can update
//Need to implement properly Team inventory, hero stats and map use on base (also need to trigger updates on reentry)
//Need to change team so that it holds variables like shopPrice and handles death
//Need to finish implementing villainsLairPanel -> implement damage to hero/villains, death to hero/villains/team, rewards and continuing to next city
//Need to add winning the game
//Fix base camp GUI
//Try to fix gui rescaling in Shop
//Add in powerup description in PowerupDen
//challenging hero's name on dice rolls

Make it so the inventory is sorted (treeMap)

Need to make it look not trash
	- Normalise fonts
	- Possibly make it so you can't change heroes in a battle after a draw --> 
	- Make code layout uniform
	- Remove copy() from item
	- Change powerup type from using instanceof to 


Known bugs:
On ARAM hero 110% displays as 110.0000000001%
